# Smart-Contracts

   The smart contracts are made on the Ethereum blockchain using solidity >=0.6.10 .
   
   ##1. Bequeath:-
    It's a contract that lets your kin or anyone of your choice take your funds after your time in this world.
    
    You convert your assets into ether and put it in the smart contract.
    You check-in every year to tell the smart contract that you're still alive and to extend the validity by (say) one more year or any time period. 
    When you fail to check-in ,the smart contract lets your kin/anyone to tranfer your funds into their account.
    Only the owner can check-in and extend the time by a year. But the funds can be transferred by that kin/anyone.
    Since this will be on the blockchain, so, it will be peer-to-peer and anybody can view it and verify its authenticity.
    
   ##2. Crowdfund:-
    This smart contract can be used to create or back a crowdfund without any of the backers getting scammed.
    
    This is similar to the website "Kickstarter", however, Kickstarter unfortunately has given scammers and fraudsters a new potential untapped reserve of money to trick           people out like none other before it.
    With this smart contract, you can either choose to create or back a crowdfund.
    If you back a project, the project manager will have to call for the votes of the backers everytime he/she tries to use that money for the project.
    The project manager will have to provide the details of where and the money is being sent and for what.
    The backer will have complete knowledge of what is going on behind the scenes without worrying about scammers and fraudsters.
